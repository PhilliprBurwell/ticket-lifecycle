#3 Resolving the Ticket I demonstrated exceptional communication and problem-solving skills while addressing a Sev A issue reported by Karen, the head of a banking company, through the osTicketing system. After identifying the urgency of the issue from her tone, I promptly initiated a phone conversation to gather details and reassure her. The banking team suspected the recent updates were the root cause. I acknowledged their concerns, explained our testing process, and assured them I would investigate further. After analysis, it was confirmed that the update caused the outage. I coordinated the rollback of the changes, notified the vendor, and restored system functionality.
